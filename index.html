            <h3>Species Overview:</h3>
            <p><strong>Betta fish</strong> (<em>Betta splendens</em>), also known as Siamese fighting fish, are popular 
                freshwater fish celebrated for their vivid colors and elegant, flowing fins. Native to Southeast Asia,

            <h2>Creating a Perfect Home for Goldfish</h2>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Learn the essentials of setting up a goldfish tank that promotes health and longevity.</p>
            <h3>Species Overview:</h3>
            <p><strong>Goldfish</strong> (<em>Carassius auratus</em>) are hardy, colorful freshwater fish originating from East Asia,
                 commonly kept as pets due to their adaptability and ease of care. Known for their vibrant hues and diverse varieties,
                  including common, comet, and fancy goldfish, they can live 10-15 years or longer with proper care.
                   Goldfish require a spacious tank or pond to thrive, as they produce considerable waste. 
                   A minimum of 20 gallons per goldfish is recommended to maintain water quality. 
                   Their tank should be equipped with a good filtration system and regular water changes to 
                   keep ammonia and nitrate levels low. Goldfish thrive on a varied diet of flakes, pellets, 
                   and occasional treats like peas and bloodworms. Avoid overfeeding to prevent digestive issues 
                   and maintain a clean environment. With adequate space, clean water, and a balanced diet,
                    goldfish can grow, flourish, and display their best colors.</p>

            <h3>Goldfish Care Guide</h3>
            <h4>Habitat</h4>
            <p>Goldfish (Carassius auratus) are freshwater fish originating from East Asia. They are known for their adaptability and vibrant colors, including varieties such as common, comet, and fancy goldfish. To thrive, goldfish require a spacious environment. A minimum of 20 gallons per goldfish is recommended to ensure ample space and maintain water quality. They can be kept in tanks or ponds, but larger tanks are preferable due to their high waste production.</p>
            <p>To replicate their natural habitat in an aquarium:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tank Size:</strong> Minimum of 20 gallons per goldfish.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Parameters:</strong> Goldfish prefer cooler water, typically between 65-75°F (18-24°C), with a pH range of 7.0-8.4.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> A robust filtration system is essential to keep the water clean and free of harmful ammonia and nitrates.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Changes:</strong> Regular water changes (about 25% weekly) help maintain water quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Diet</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Staple Diet:</strong> High-quality goldfish flakes or pellets.</li>
                <li><strong>Supplementary Foods:</strong> Vegetables (like peas and spinach), bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.</li>
                <li><strong>Feeding Frequency:</strong> Feed small amounts 2-3 times daily, ensuring they consume the food within 2 minutes to prevent overfeeding and water pollution.</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Tank Mates</h4>
            <p>Goldfish can coexist with other cold-water fish that are similar in size and temperament. Suitable tank mates include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Other goldfish varieties</li>
                <li>White Cloud Mountain Minnows</li>
                <li>Weather Loaches. Avoid aggressive or fin-nipping fish and tropical species that require warmer water.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Life Span</h4>
            <p>With proper care, goldfish can live 10-15 years or longer. Ensuring they have adequate space, clean water, and a balanced diet is crucial for their health and longevity.</p>
